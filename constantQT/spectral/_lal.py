# A Constant Q Transform based on *GWpy qtransform* 
#   The creation of this program was inspired by the need to include a CQT package 
#       with minimal size and dependency for SHARCNET (ComputeCanada) Supercomputer Clusters.
# 
# IMPORTANT: All credits for the original Q transform algorithm go to the authors of *GWpy* and *Omega* pipeline.
# See original algorithms at: [Omega Scan] https://gwdetchar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/omega/
